Create multiple accounts

Deposit and withdraw money

View account balances

Keep a transaction history per session

Features

Add accounts with unique account numbers

Select accounts from a dropdown list (JComboBox)

Deposit and withdraw money safely (with balance checks)

View balances in real time

Transaction log (JList) with account-specific activity

Technologies Used

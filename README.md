Banking App (Java Swing + MySQL)

This is a simple Java Swing application I built as a refresher while preparing for my masterâ€™s class in Java.
It simulates a small banking system where you can:

Create multiple accounts

Deposit and withdraw money

View account balances

Keep a transaction history per session

Persist accounts and transactions into a MySQL database

 Features

Add accounts with unique account numbers

Select accounts from a dropdown list (JComboBox)

Deposit and withdraw money safely (with balance checks)

View balances in real time

Transaction log (JList) with account-specific activity

Database integration with MySQL (accounts + transactions tables)

 Technologies Used

Java 17+ (works with Java 8 as well)

Swing (GUI framework)

MySQL (database)
